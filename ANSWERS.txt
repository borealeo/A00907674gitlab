Holy ***
I could not for the life of me understand why i was running into so many problems.
In reality, all i had to do was

1. git init
to initialize a local repository
2. git add .
to add all local files
3. git commit -m "something commit something"
to commit int
4. git remote add origin https://github.com/borealeo/A00907674gitlab.git
to add the github made repository
5. git push -u origin
to push it to the local "origin"



but I don't know why I kept running into branch not existing or not current branch problems
or cannot push because of non-existant files that are effecting the matching repository
Sigh
Took way too long.
